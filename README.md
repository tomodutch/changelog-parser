## Requirements
- php 7.1 or greater ([supported versions](http://php.net/supported-versions.php))

## Why
A changelog contains information about all the changes in a project.
This parsers can be used to extract information about a specific release.
That information may then be distributed towards your friends, clients, colleagues and other parties.

## Installation

```bash
composer require tfarla/changelog-parser
```

## Usage

Given we have the following markdown file:

```md
## 1.0.0 - 2018-12-20
### Added
- A cool new feature

### Changed
- that thing that was too complex
- slow code into fast code

### Removed
- A gastly bug
```

When we parse that markdown file using the `MarkdownParser`:

```php
<?php

use \TFarla\ChangelogParser\MarkdownParser;

$parser = new MarkdownParser();

$result = $parser->parse(file_get_contents('CHANGELOG.md'));

foreach ($result->getReleases() as $release) {
    echo $release->getVersion() . PHP_EOL;
    echo $release->getDate()->format('Y-m-d') . PHP_EOL;
    foreach ($release->getChanges() as $type => $changes) {
        echo $type . PHP_EOL;
        foreach ($changes as $change) {
            echo "- $change" . PHP_EOL;
        }
    }
}
```

Then we will receive the following output:
```bash
1.0.0
2018-12-20
Added
- A cool new feature
Changed
- that thing that was too complex
- slow code into fast code
Removed
- A gastly bug
```

## Running tests
This project uses [golden files](https://medium.com/soon-london/testing-with-golden-files-in-go-7fccc71c43d3) to assert expected behaviour.
These golden files should be part stored in the git repository and can be generated by setting the `GOLDEN` environment variable to `1`:
```bash
GOLDEN=1 composer test
```
